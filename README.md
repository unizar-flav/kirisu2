*Simple editor for stopped-flow and other spectra*


## Usage
It is expected to use the [Jupyter Notebook at Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unizar-flav/kirisu2/blob/master/kirisu2.ipynb) to run the code.

Run each cell in order, with special attention to the first one that only is needed to be executed once.

Upload a spectra file and process it until the desired output is obtained. Finally, download it.
